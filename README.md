Qwen3-235B-A22B: Generate a GitHub file structure to put experimental works of a PhD project entitled "The macro-determinants of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) demand in developed and developing countries" in which we have the following important experiments that we will upload the jupyter-notebooks, and so we need Mardown notation to describe the code and data used

1. ESG Score Data Collection - we proposed a new approach to assessing the ESG practices of startups that find funding through ICOs. 
2. Fuzzy C-Means Clustering -  the Fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm to identify patterns and clusters in the data.
3. Dimensionality Reduction with  T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) - t-SNE models the similarities between pairs of points in the high-dimensional space as conditional probabilities. In this way, the t-SNE method reduces the complexity of data for visualisation in two or three dimensions through a nonlinear and probabilistic mapping.

Here’s a proposed GitHub file structure for the PhD project, organized to clarify experimental workflows and 
documentation. Each folder includes a README.md to describe its contents, citing relevant sources where applicable:
